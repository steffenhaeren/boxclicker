Hi!
Thank for downloading BOXCLICKER!
It's my first game and I hope it makes you smile.
Rightclick on "index.html" and open it in Google Chrome.

BOXCLICKER is a short game, inspired by Cookie Clicker, but with a twist. 
I've been working on BOXCLICKER for a few months in my spare time. 
I started to learn coding after the summer in 2018 in my last year in High School, so expect some bugs. 
All in all I'm quite happy how it turned out, with my lesser coding experience. 
It would mean so much, if you left a comment and share what you think, positive or negative!<3

ENJOY<3

P.S: if you finsh the game and think "thats it????", keep on clicking :D
